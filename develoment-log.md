- Most of this evening was spent sorting out the work from 2021-01-04 into nice commits.
- Have resolved issues between osx / windows local environments
- Have started considering design, purchased https://friendkit.cssninja.io/ as a source of inspiration. Would be nice if I could just use that, but paying for a template and then open sourcing it seems rude? ^_^

- https://medium.com/hackernoon/building-a-website-with-react-and-bulma-d655214bff2a helpful for adding Bulma into the mix without having to dive into getting away from `react-scripts start` yet.
- Focusing on getting a basic design running in Bulma, makes sense to me to start this earlier as the front-end code will rely on UI existing.
- Looked into React Native and Iconic, as I want an app of this at some point. However right now I don't see either as particularly useful to me. I like the idea of Iconic and one code base, but it has performance issues, probably fine for my use case, but why bother. React Native has plugins to deal with web, but it just seems wrong. PWA focused for now.

- Article was helpful on working through CORS issues etc.
- Have homestead setup now to support both running with LiveReload and standard builds.
- Basic authentication system in place.

- Going through https://laravel-news.com/using-sanctum-to-authenticate-a-react-spa which seems to be a good example of how to use a laravel/sanctum/reactJS setup.
- Having issues with getting homestead/vagrant to properly load the front-end with routing.
